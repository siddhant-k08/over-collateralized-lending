## Lessons

### Bug Fix: Invalid Icon Imports
**Issue**: Application was crashing with "Element type is invalid" error due to non-existent Heroicons imports.

**Root Cause**: Used incorrect icon names in Footer.tsx:
- `GithubIcon` (doesn't exist)
- `CodeBracketIcon` (doesn't exist)

**Solution**: Replaced with correct Heroicons:
- `GithubIcon` â†’ `CodeBracketSquareIcon`
- `CodeBracketIcon` â†’ `CommandLineIcon`

**Prevention**: Always verify icon names exist in the Heroicons library before importing. Check existing codebase for correct import patterns.

**Status**: âœ… Fixed - Application now running successfully (HTTP 200)
